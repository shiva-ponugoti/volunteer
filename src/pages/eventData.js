      "Every year, the Ocean Conservancy hosts a coastal cleanup. The cleanups happen simultaneously across several locations on the same day. In 2018, they urged their global network of volunteers to “Suit up, Clean Up” for their 33rd annual International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). More than 1 million volunteers came together globally to pick up trash and clear the coasts closest to them leading to it being one of the biggest and most successful beach clean-ups. Approximately 23 million pounds of it in just one day!",
